## Purpose
Calculator Core is a lightweight program that remotely interacts with and monitors devices. Uses socket programming and threading. Client and server programs can be implemented for many purposes, with some examples including monitoring computer usage, tracking the location of devices within a network, monitoring for suspicious activity, and gathering data on computer usage habits.

I'm currently working on packaging the client and server source code into a library that will allow device owners to easily implement these remote features and repurpose them to suit their needs.

I'm hoping that this library can be used by company/school administration, people managing large networks of devices, and groups hoping to prevent unauthorized activity among devices or perform statistical analyses on their hardware usage.

Video demonstration is coming soon.
